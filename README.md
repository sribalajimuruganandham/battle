# battle
A strategy project where a king assigns 5 platoons to attack 5 enemy platoons. Each has a specific soldier type. The goal is to find the best matchups to win at least 3 out of 5 battles. The program checks all possible assignments and picks the one that gives the highest chance of victory.
